# Python For Beginners

Hello, novice Pytohnistas! I created this repository for absolute beginners of
Python 3 for my club, Code@IU. Learning to code can be a very overwhelming 
process because you might not know where to begin. If you feel like you are at 
that state, then this repository is for you. The following topics will be
covered:
* [1. print( ) and basic data types](https://github.com/benfwalla/Python-For-Beginners/blob/master/1_basic_data_types.py)
* [2. Variables](https://github.com/benfwalla/Python-For-Beginners/blob/master/2_variables.py)
* [3. Booleans and if statements](https://github.com/benfwalla/Python-For-Beginners/blob/master/3_boolean_logic.py)
* [4. Lists](https://github.com/benfwalla/Python-For-Beginners/blob/master/4_lists.py)
* [5. for loops](https://github.com/benfwalla/Python-For-Beginners/blob/master/5_for_loops.py)
* [6. Functions](https://github.com/benfwalla/Python-For-Beginners/blob/master/6_functions.py)
* [7. Importing modules](https://github.com/benfwalla/Python-For-Beginners/blob/master/7_imports.py)
* [8. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](https://github.com/benfwalla/Python-For-Beginners/blob/master/8_object_oriented_programming.py)
* [9. Blockchain Class](https://github.com/benfwalla/Python-For-Beginners/blob/master/9_Blockchain_Class.py)

Each file will have thorough documentation that should make it easy to
follow along.

A quick disclaimer: this repository is meant for absolute beginners! It is
meant to be clear and concise. By no means do these scripts explain the
concepts in totality. In fact, I'd say that it barely skims the surface! The
goal of this repository is to give a beginner the confidence to explore the
world of Python with the syntax and terminology to succeed. 

### Installing Python 3
Since you're probably a beginner of Python, you probably will not have it
installed. In order to run the code in this folder, you will not to [install
Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to your local computer. You will also need to [download Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3),
which is a super simple text editor to write your Python.

I created a pretty nifty set of slides to download Python 3 and Sublime on your
Mac or PC. You can view the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mQYxUIxNDt13_VMecqVyM00Zv5uLiY9nGHUmqHTBWz8/edit?usp=sharing).
